This is a game made in Pygame using Python 2.7. The game is played using the up,down,left and right keys on the keyboard. The whole point of the game is to collect the green squares without collecting the red squares. If a green square is collected, a point towards the score is awarded. If a red square is collected a point is subtracted from score. To play this game simply, compile and run sprite_collect_blocks.py in an IDE like Portable Python.
